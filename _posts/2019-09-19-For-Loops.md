title: For Loops
categories: C# Programming Iteration
---
For loops is one of three types of iteration, it will execute a command a certain number of times and then stop.
Iteration is the technical term for looping.
```csharp
for (int = 0; i < 1000; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(i);
}
Console.Readline();
```
The above program should very quickly display the numbers 1 to 1000.

```csharp
for (int = 0; i < 1000; i++)
//       a        b      c
```
a- This defines an integer variable and assignes a value of 0

b- This is the logic used in the for loop, it checks that i is less than 1000

c- If the criteria of 'b' is met, the command in 'c' will execute


For loops are very useful for very quickly executing commands over and over.

You can also nest loops (putting a loop inside of another loop)
