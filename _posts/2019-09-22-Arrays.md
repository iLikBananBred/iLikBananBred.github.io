An array is a row of variables, each variable is assigned an integer value, starting from 0.
Arrays are defined and assigned in the following way
```csharp
string[] student = new string [5]
student[0] = "Nolly";
student[1] = "Sabba";
student[2] = "Hatty";
student[3] = "Beth";
student[4] = "Jade";
```
You can then print out the contents of the array individually or consecutively with a loop.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(student[0]);
Console.WriteLine(student[1]);
Console.WriteLine(student[2]);
Console.WriteLine(student[3]);
Console.WriteLine(student[4]);
```
Or
```csharp
for (int i = 0; i<=4; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(student[i]);
}
```
You can use a for loop to assign values to the array as well using similar logic to the above code, instead of 
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(student[i]);
```
You would write
```csharp
student[i] = "Insert array contents";
```
For example, you could use this to create an array containing 100 random numbers.

All the examples shown up until now are one dimensional arrays. A two dimensional array is made up of rows and columns, like a table.
To declare and assign two dimensional arrays you will use the following code.

```csharp
int[,] test = new int[4,2];

test[0,0] = 0;
test[0,1] = 184;
test[0,2] = 56;
test[0,3] = 160;

test[1,0] = 192;
test[1,1] = 64;
test[1,2] = 91;
test[1,3] = 11;
```
