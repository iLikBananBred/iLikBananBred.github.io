For loops allow a line of code to be executed until a criteria is met. They are a type of iteration, which is fancy speech for looping.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Input an integer");
int x = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
Console.WriteLine("");
for (int i = 1; i < 11; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine(x + " times " + i + " is " + i*x);
}
Console.ReadLine();
```
The above code will print out the first ten values in a specific number's multiplication table, determined by the user.

```csharp
for (int i = 1; i < 11; i++)
//      a         b      c                    
```
a- Creates an integer variable called i
b- Provides the logic for the loop
c- A command that is executed after the logic from part b has been applied
