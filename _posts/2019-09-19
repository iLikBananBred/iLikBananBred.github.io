User inputs can be stored as variables and used later in the program
```csharp
int children;
Console.WriteLine("How many children are there?");
children = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
```

These variables can be called later to cite the user input in the program, this can be used to display the users name and other such values.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("There are " + children + " children")
```
Inputs and outputs are vital for programs to be effective as without user input the program would be very limited.

An example of an output is the .WriteLine commmand.
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Example text goes here")
```
