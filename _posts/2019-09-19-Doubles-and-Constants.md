Doubles represent decimal numbers.
```csharp
double miles = 7.4;
```
If a double is divided, the answer is (unless specified) given as an integer, to fix this we do the following
```csharp
double third = number / 3.0;

```
The .0 tells the computer to leave the answer as a decimal because you are dividing a double by another double.
Without the .0, the answer would be left as a whole number by truncation. (2.4 becomes 2, as does 2.9)



Constants are created using the keyword const, they cannot be changed later in the program and thus can only be assigned once.
```csharp
const in ROOMS = 15;
```
This creates variable ROOMS and it can only ever be 15, so
```csharp
ROOMS++;
```
Would not be allowed, it would cause a build error.
