Programs execute commands in sequence, line 2 is executed after line 1
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("This is executed first");
Console.WriteLine("This is executed second");
```

A computer cannot determine what order to execute our code in, so sequence in code is important:
```csharp
num -= 5
int num = 7
```
This would make no sense to a computer and would likely not compile as the sequence is incorrect
